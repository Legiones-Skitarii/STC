*Note: The intro may be a bit long for your taste, so skip ahead if you feel like it. Also, this is on the rambling side, given my taste for a well structured essay has deteriorated (ok that's a lie, but I'm not structuring this one). But it is rambling for I wish it to be. It's been long since I've been here, and I must admit I like it. For better, or worse.*

### Intro
Social Media really is annoying sometimes. Instagram has the effect of ruining the idea of what a good weekend is, LinkedIn has the effect of ruining whatever image of professionalism I conjure up when I think of suited professionals. Even twitter (I'm sorry, X) is only slightly more tolerable (I love the people, but by god can I do without the nonsense).

The problem of twitter (for me), is the inevitable problem when you have a room with ever shifting puzzles in front of you. Whenever one puzzle ceases to amuse you, its incredibly easy to simply pick up another, and for lack of better discipline (it's hard folks, what can I say?), it inevitably follows that the nerd sniping always happens.

And there always does exist another puzzle. Either you go up the abstraction chain or down the implementation one, whichever suits your fancy and whatever comes easier (or harder, if you're into that sorta thing)

But the worst problem comes when you start in the middle, where you look all around you and all you find are weird abstractions and ridiculous opinionations, compounded upon the fact that you must navigate through the slop of their inadequacies and your own incomplete understanding of their history and their faults.

When one is usually mired in these sort of quandaries of philosophical pondering in the middle of the desert with nothing but a laptop and an internet connection, the hope that there is an oasis of truth is the only idea that allows some justification of wandering over lying down and pissing on a rock, despite the idea that such a truth exists is really more of an ad-hoc justification than the actual reason, i.e wandering around is fun. Blame ADHD if you like. Most people do anyway.

And then there be posers, scam artists who peddle in nonsense and trade in currency, yet somehow revered as knowledge creators, who stand in the desert hoping that they may cause enough salivation to create their own oasis.

In the middle of all this, there may be solution that is missing, which is incredibly and I must admit, weirdly, nice.

Just pissing on a rock.

### No Phones
Desert analogies aside, I had my phone off for about 3 weeks, and the peace I had was beautiful. My main mode of communication was email, and for the most part I was penniless (paisaless actually, but who cares ?) due to a lack of hard cash, but for the most part, it was one of the more weirdly cheerful 3 weeks of my life.

The reverence I afforded my phone was replaced by a cold disgust, and I must admit, a well deserved one.

The only uses I found for my phone was for 
1. The clock
2. Maps
3. Online pay
4. Checking mail

Most of my calls were scheduled on email, with some or the other software being utilised for the same. And no social media, so I had no compulsive need to check anything.

And something I realised was simply that without the nerd sniping that usually happens on online platforms such as social media, it's totally possible to build your own oasis of knowledge by simple
1. Talking to people around you
2. Reading a couple of books
3. Just fucking talking to people.

Seriously. It's weird this feels like some sort of revelation, but being away from social media stopped me from being nerd sniped quite extensively. In quite some time, it felt like I actually worked on something (I just read a bit of Linear Algebra). In all fairness, I had the wisdom I stole from people older than me (I gotta buy the old man some drinks) and I have failed enough to succeed just a little bit, and I'm still mostly broke.

But for the most part, I realised that a lot of stuff just doesn't matter. Scratch that. Nothing except what you're currently working on matters. Not languages, not editors, not nothing.

Obvious, and yet the nerdsniping often continues cuz puzzles be good.

### Choices
The main point to be taken away is that too many choices suck. You want to paralyze someone, give them 20 brands of ketchup (cue Ethan Hunt throwing 20 brands of shampoo at the antagonist to stun them for a second). And you wanna make sure someone doesn't learn anything, give them 30 different books on 10 different topics.

Now, some moron might come along and start arguing this point, so I'll clarify. Giving a beginner 30 different books is quite different from giving an wiser (not older. Wisdom and age are often corelated, but my experience suggests a tenuous relation at best) person the same amount, since a beginner usually is drowned in information and the wise man knows what to reject. (Any more arguments about semantics, I'll pick one to read and throw the other 29 at you. Books well spent, in my opinion.)

Anyway, the lack of a phone (and the subsequent lack of any social media or instant messaging) was liberating because it restricted choices. While it can be fun to talk to people online and form network states (hello fellow patriots!), the disadvantages of always being on edge and always checking for new things is exhausting, more than I thought it was.

There's always more, always more, always more, always more. Nothing is stable long enough to hold onto and I think this is incredibly destructive. I'm not a luddite by any means, but the algorithms be wilding.

And there's no winning against it. You are a mammal, susceptible to animal instincts that people sitting in offices are being trained to exploit for more and more of your attention. Your reptilian brain responds, despite your conscious awareness of the problems it can cause.

For worse, you're hooked into the chaotic zeitgeist, with no reprieve save for the one you provide yourself. So the best thing to do is to stop. The only winning move is not to play.

### Conclusion
* **Shifting to email** : Besides the usual, I'm probably gonna keep my phone off for very long periods of time. Nobody says anything on a phone that cannot be conveyed in an email, and whenever that time arrives, it will be words well spent (I can only hope).

That's about it.

General advice. Once weened off this (phone/SM/instant messaging), you'll usually find it's much more relaxed than usual and you probably will find a lot of time for other plans.

On that note, wanna go for a cup of tea ?
