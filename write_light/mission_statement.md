# A fellowship of minds

## Introduction
Writing a mission statement is one of those things that seems....weird. In a lot of ways, you're writing down your hopes, and solidifiing that into the written word is bound to give rise to disappointment. Inevitably, life falls short, for when does it not if your dreams are those of galactic conquest ?

There's no ships that can sail the stars now, nor there be colonies to expand from. Yet an empire that stretches the galaxy is a sight to behold, and a dream of conquest be what we have.

But even the empire is not a goal, but a means to an end, for each mind must recieve a universe to play around in, for makes minds grow but creation ? And what be the point of it without the story of humanity to accompany it ?

The future will arrive no matter what it entails, for good or for bad. What will happen will happen, but that's no excuse to do nothing.

## Mission Statement
I want to be involved in technology and understanding it on a fundamental level so I may possess the some means creation in my hands. I want to shape worlds while I live, digital or otherwise. To create what I believe in.

And I want people to shape these worlds with. People I can rely on and talk to. The journey is long and lonely, and towards the end, they'll be no one but each other to look for comfort in a world that will inevitably move on. A fellowship of minds is what I desire, who in due time, will pass the torch on to brighter ones.

Society will change as technology changes, and so I will be inevitably be complicit in the change of society. I won't be malicious, but I will watch it change and the battles that will be fought because of it. As a technologist, I will fight for freedom, for from a free mind does progress flow. The freedom to think and the freedom to be.

All of this will require discipline, determination and the resources to sustain oneself and others. A person who cannot think logistics will fail, and so I must think logistically. This is war, a war against the universe for humanity, and war requires resources. And so I will earn, and take care of those around me, and help those who I can. I will strive to become the strong pillar upon whose efforts I hope people will build.

I have no timelines to speak of, but I will plan in my own head. For all plans are useless, but planning is invaluable.
